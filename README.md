# Hello Friend 👋
## Introduction 🙋‍♂️
I'm **Swift Coffin**, a person who is a privacy advocate and a hobby programmer. I am also a casual gamer too. 
## Why I am here ? 🤔
Well, I want to create some repos to help people regain their online privacy.
## How can I help ? 🤝
I will create  softwares, scripts and resources to help you enhance your knowledge about privacy and security in general. Tbh, I would be more focused on **mobile** security and privacy (Android specifically).
